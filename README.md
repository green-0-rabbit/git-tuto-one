# Project README

This README provides information on Git, Linux commands, Python, ZSH configuration, and the SSH agent setup.

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects. Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, Git is a crucial tool in the modern development workflow. To learn more about Git and how to synchronize your work with others, you can start with the following tutorial:
- [Git Pull Tutorial by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull)

## Linux Commands
Linux commands are essential for navigating and managing your operating system. Detailed commands and tutorials will be defined and linked here subsequently.

## Python
Python is a powerful and versatile programming language, widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. 

### Installation
- Python3 is already installed on Debian-based OS (Debian & Ubuntu).
- To install the required packages for development, use:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv build-essential python3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-venv
  ```

```

## SSH-Agent Configuration
For a seamless experience with SSH keys and authentication, configure your SSH agent as follows:
```bash
zstyle :omz:plugins:ssh-agent quiet yes
zstyle :omz:plugins:ssh-agent identities github_ed25519
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

## Linux
